# for i in range (5):
  #  print(i)

# range(2, 5), which means values from 2 to 5 (but not including 5)
# for i in range (2,5):
#     print(i)

# Increment the sequence with 5 (default is 1):
# for i in range(2, 20 , 5):
#     print(i)

# Here, else keyword indicates a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
